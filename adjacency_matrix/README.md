# Adjacency matrix

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix)

* Space complexity: O(n²), where n is the number of vertices.
* Time complexity:
    * Test if an edge is in the graph: O(1).
    * Find the degree of a vertex: O(n) (or O(1) if a counter is kept for each vertex).
    * Insert or delete an edge: O(1).
    * Traverse the graph: O(n²).

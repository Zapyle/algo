# Splay tree

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree)

* Space complexity: O(n).
* Time complexity:
    * Search: O(log n).
    * Insert: O(log n).
    * Delete: O(log n).

The binary search trees implemented here are not self-balanced, and all operations are done recursively.

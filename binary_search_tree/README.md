# Binary search tree

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree)

* Space complexity: O(n).
* Time complexity:
    * Search: worst case O(n), average case O(log n).
    * Insert: worst case O(n), average case O(log n).
    * Delete: worst case O(n), average case O(log n).
* In-order traversal returns a list of the elements in sorted order.

The binary search trees implemented here are not self-balanced, and all operations are done recursively.

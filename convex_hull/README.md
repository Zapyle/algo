# Convex hull

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull)

The algorithm implemented here is the [gift wrapping algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_wrapping_algorithm). It runs in O(nh) time, where n is the number of points and h the number of points on the convex hull.

# Convex hull

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull)

The algorithms implemented here are:

- The [gift wrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_wrapping_algorithm) algorithm, also called *Jarvis march*. It runs in O(nh) time, where n is the number of points and h the number of points on the convex hull.
- The [Graham scan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_scan) algorithm. It runs in O(n log n) time.

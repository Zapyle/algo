# String matching

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_searching_algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_searching_algorithm)

The algorithm implemented here is [Knuth–Morris–Pratt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm).

Time complexity: O(m + n), where m is the length of the pattern and n the length of the searchable text.

See also the module [generalized_suffix_tree](../generalized_suffix_tree), which offers great performance for various string searching operations.

# Kernighan–Lin algorithm

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernighan–Lin_algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernighan%E2%80%93Lin_algorithm)

The Kernighan–Lin algorithm is a heuristic for [partitioning graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_partition).

Time complexity: O(n³) with this naïve implementation. Inline comments indicate how to reduce it to O(n² log n).

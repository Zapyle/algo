# Splay tree

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splay_tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splay_tree)

* Space complexity: O(n).
* Time complexity:
    * Search: amortized O(log n).
    * Insert: amortized O(log n).
    * Delete: amortized O(log n).

The splay trees implemented here use top-down splaying, inspired from [ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/usr/sleator/splaying/SplayTree.java](ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/usr/sleator/splaying/SplayTree.java) and [ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/usr/sleator/splaying/top-down-splay.c](ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/usr/sleator/splaying/top-down-splay.c). These files are also saved in this directory in case the links go dead.

# Sieve of Eratosthenes

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)

The sieves implemented here are inspired from [http://code.activestate.com/recipes/117119/](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/117119/).

Further optimization is possible, but has been left out to keep the code simple. See [http://stackoverflow.com/a/568618](http://stackoverflow.com/a/568618).

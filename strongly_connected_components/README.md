# Strongly connected components

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component)

The algorithm implemented here is a variant of [Kosaraju's algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosaraju%27s_algorithm): instead of using a stack, each vertex is labelled with its depth-first search completion order.

# Minimum feedback edge set

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_arc_set#Minimum_feedback_arc_set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_arc_set#Minimum_feedback_arc_set)

Also called *minimum feedback arc set* problem, or *maximum acyclic subgraph* problem.

The heuristic implemented here runs in O(n + m) time, where n is the number of vertices and m the number of edges in the graph.

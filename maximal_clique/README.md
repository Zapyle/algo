# Maximal clique

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_problem)

This algorithm finds a maximal clique in O(n + m) time, where n is the number of vertices and m the number of edges.

Do not confuse maximal clique and maximum clique:
* A maximal clique is a clique that cannot be extended by adding any additional vertex.
* A maximum clique is a clique such that there is no clique with more vertices. Finding a maximum clique is NP-complete.

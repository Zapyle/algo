# Dijkstra's algorithm

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)

* Suitable for finding shortest paths in directed or undirected weighted graphs with positive weights only.
* Time complexity: O(n²), where n is the number of vertices. Can be optimized with a min-priority queue to run in O(m + n log n), where m is the number of edges.
* Space complexity: O(n²).

# Intersection detection

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment_intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment_intersection)

The algorithm implemented here is the [Bentleyâ€“Ottmann algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentley%E2%80%93Ottmann_algorithm). It returns all k intersections of a set of n line segments in O((n + k) log n) time.

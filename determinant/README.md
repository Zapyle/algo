# Determinant

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant)

The determinant of a matrix can be used to solve several problems:

- Testing whether a matrix is singular.
- Computing the area of a triangle, or the volume of a tetrahedron or other simplex.
- Testing whether a set of 3 points are collinear, or whether a set of d+1 points are coplanar in d dimensions. (This reduces to checking if the triangle or simplex defined by these points has an area or volume equal to 0.)
- Testing whether a point lies to the left or right of a line of plane.


All of these are implemented here.

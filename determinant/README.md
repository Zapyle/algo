# Determinant

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant)

The determinant of a matrix can be used to solve several problems:

- Testing whether a matrix is singular, i.e. does not have an inverse.
- Testing whether a set of n points lies on a plane in fewer than n dimensions.
- Testing whether a point lies to the left or right of a line of plane.
- Computing the area of a triangle, or the volume of a tetrahedron or other simplex.

All of these are implemented here.

# Red-black tree

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red–black_tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red–black_tree)

* Space complexity: O(n).
* Time complexity:
    * Search: O(log n).
    * Insert: O(log n).
    * Delete: O(log n).

The red-black trees implemented here are the traditional version (non left-leaning) with bottom-up insertion and deletion.

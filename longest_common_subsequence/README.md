# Longest common subsequence

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem)

The algorithm implemented here returns the longest common subsequence of two strings in O(mn) space and O(mn) time, where m and n are the lengths of the strings.

The module [levenshtein_distance](../levenshtein_distance) uses a very similar algorithm to measure the edit distance between two strings.
